# Project Structure

This repository is the public web root for the VNFest Galgame club map. Root-level HTML files are kept in place because they are public routes.

## Public Runtime

- `admin/` - admin pages.
- `api/` - PHP API endpoints.
- `css/` - shared page styles.
- `js/` - shared browser scripts.
- `includes/` - PHP shared modules.
- `data/` - runtime data placeholders and protected writable folders.
- `uploads/` - protected upload placeholders.
- `image/background/` - local background image drop folder.
- `images/` - bundled site images and icons.
- `wiki/` - generated Wiki pages, content JSON, and Wiki library files.
- `moe/` - Moe contest pages and assets.
- `twelve/` - Twelve contest pages and assets.
- `Galgame_events/` - GalOnly activity pages; public assets live in `Galgame_events/assets/`.
- `JUYOU/` - JUYOU event page and local assets.
- `club-operation-portrait/` - standalone club operation portrait tool.
- `Game/galgame_club_sim/` - standalone Galgame club simulator.
- `tools/` - small public utility pages.
- `user-v2-assets/` - built assets used by the root `user.html` entry.

## Public Root Entries

The following files intentionally stay at the web root so existing links keep working:

- `index.html`
- `login.html`
- `user.html`
- `user-v2.html`
- `club_square.html`
- `club_share.html`
- `vote.html`
- `star_map.html`
- `submit.html`
- `submit_event.html`
- `submit_publication.html`
- `feedback.html`

## Development And Operations

- `scripts/` - tests, migrations, generators, and packaging helpers.
- `user-v2-react/` - source project for the rebuilt user center.
- `docs/` - local design/reference workspace; ignored by Git.
- `_local/` - ignored local quarantine for logs, archives, duplicate exports, and source materials that should not affect runtime checks or builds.

## Organization Rules

- Keep public URL entry files at the root unless a redirect or compatibility wrapper is added.
- Put feature-owned browser assets inside that feature directory, such as `Galgame_events/assets/`.
- Keep PHP endpoints in `api/`; do not place API copies under `js/`.
- Keep browser scripts in `js/`; do not nest a second `js/` folder inside it.
- Keep logs, compressed backups, exported archives, and raw source materials under `_local/` or another ignored operations directory.
