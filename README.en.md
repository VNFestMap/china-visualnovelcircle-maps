## What Is This

**VNFest** (Visual Novel Festival) is not just a circle directory. It is a lightweight operations platform purpose-built for visual novel clubs, linking together map navigation, club profile management, member administration, event calendars, publication calls for submissions, project collaboration, voting contests, and a Wiki encyclopedia into one seamless workflow.

Whether you are an enthusiast looking for a club, a club admin maintaining your organization's information, an event organizer planning activities, or an editor contributing to the encyclopedia — VNFest has a dedicated entry point for you.

## Features in Detail

### 🗺️ Map & Discovery

The core VNFest experience begins with an interactive map.

The China map covers all provinces, and the Japan map is precise down to the prefecture level, with each region displaying registered visual novel circles. Click any area to view that region's circle list, or switch freely between map view and list view.

In addition to map browsing, the platform provides a province index, keyword search, type filtering (school clubs / community organizations / online communities), and multi-dimensional sorting for discovery. A single circle can be associated with multiple provinces, ensuring cross-regional organizations are properly represented.

Guests can browse all map data and circle details without logging in; once logged in, users gain access to management controls for editing the clubs they are responsible for.

### 📋 Circle Profiles

Every circle has a comprehensive profile page, including name, region, affiliated school, organization type, contact information, and a detailed introduction.

Club admins can upload and crop a club avatar, maintain the club bio, and update contact details. The system supports a three-tier permission model: regular members, circle admins, and super administrators — each role sees a different set of available actions.

For member management, the platform supports join requests, admin review, and quick-join via binding codes. Circle detail pages also feature a recommendation board (where other users can recommend their favorite clubs) and a message board (where members and visitors can leave messages and interact), turning what would be a static info page into a living community page.

### 📅 Events & Publications

The **event system** offers both a calendar view and a list view. Circle admins can publish events, manage submissions, review content, and track registration data. Users can sign up for events directly on the event page.

**Publication calls for submissions** allow admins to post submission guidelines, track submission status (pending review / accepted / published), and link publications back to the originating circle.

**GalOnly events** have their own dedicated landing page and review panel, along with a full **Staff recruitment system** — users can submit staff applications online, administrators screen candidates through voting and review workflows, and a final schedule roster is locked in.

### 🏗️ Project Hub

The Project Hub is the center of inter-club collaboration.

Admins can create project plans, invite other members, and assign roles (planning / art / writing / technical). Each project has clear status tracking — from preparation, in progress, completed, to shelved — all at a glance. Projects also support file attachments, making it easy for teams to share materials and documents.

All projects are aggregated and publicly displayed in the Circle Square, giving broader visibility to ongoing community projects.

### 🏆 Voting Contests

VNFest features a unified voting foundation that supports flexible multi-phase, multi-round configurations. Two signature contests are built on top of this system:

**Twelve** — a works-based selection system. The flow is nomination → preliminary round → group scoring/voting, ultimately producing the annual Top 12 visual novels. Data sources prioritize Bangumi search results, supplemented by VNDB data, while still providing a manual nomination entry point.

**Moe Contest** — a character-based battle system. The flow is nomination → preliminary round → power-of-2 bracket 1v1 elimination tournament, ultimately crowning the Moe King. The elimination stage features a dedicated bracket visualization component with zoom, pan, and drag interactions, displaying real-time voting status and vote counts for each match.

Both contests come with their own Hub page, detail page, and contest management backend, enabling the entire workflow from nomination to finals to be completed online.

### 👤 User Center

The v2.0 User Center is a complete rewrite, migrating from a monolithic HTML page to a React 18-based SPA architecture.

It provides a one-stop experience for profile editing, club management, messaging and notifications, and the growth system. Pages load faster, interactions are smoother, and the architecture provides a solid foundation for future feature expansion.

Supports local account registration/login, email verification codes, password recovery, as well as QQ and Discord third-party OAuth login.

### 📖 Wiki Encyclopedia

The VNFest Wiki uses an encyclopedia-style layout — left sidebar navigation + right content area — consistent with the experience of traditional Wiki sites.

The editor supports visual (WYSIWYG) editing and allows inserting images, infoboxes, timelines, external links, and structured content blocks. Content supports both Chinese and Japanese bilingual editing, meeting the needs of different user groups.

Once editing is complete, Wiki pages can be directly generated and published as static HTML with no additional build steps. The Wiki homepage provides quick-access entry points such as "Recent Changes" and "Public Archives" for easy browsing and maintenance.

### 📚 Public Archives

A digital archiving system for circle publications. Supports PDF and image format uploads, and administrators can maintain publication metadata (title, author, publication date, associated circle, etc.).

Includes a built-in PDF reader tool with 3D page-turning preview effects, allowing users to browse publication content online without downloading.

### 🌌 Circle Square

Circle Square is the information hub of the entire platform, centrally displaying all public contests, projects, and events.

Designed with a deep-space theme and featuring five-color event cards for categorical identification, users can instantly distinguish different types of community activity at a glance. Supports Chinese/Japanese bilingual switching, ensuring users of different languages can browse without barriers.

### 🌟 United Star Map

The United Star Map is a visually immersive exploration entry point.

The page adopts a Cinematic Frontend v2 design — radial gradient backgrounds, radar sweep animations, and vignette effects create an atmosphere of space exploration. Supports an immersive mode that hides HUD elements, allowing users to fully immerse themselves in starmap browsing.
